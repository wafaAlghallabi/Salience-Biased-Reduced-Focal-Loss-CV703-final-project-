# Salience-Biased-Reduced-Focal-Loss-CV703-final-project

This project has been done as a final project for CV703 - Visual Object Recognition and Detection at MBZUAI. The project is about proposing a Salience Biased Reduced Focal Loss (SBRF) which helps in increasing the contributions of well-classified samples to overcome the issue of class imbalanced in aerial images datasets. Our work is based on:

1. Detectron2.
2. REDUCED FOCAL LOSS: 1st PLACE SOLUTION TO XVIEW OBJECT DETECTION IN SATELLITE IMAGERY (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01347.pdf).
3. Salience Biased Loss for Object Detection in Aerial Images (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08103.pdf).
